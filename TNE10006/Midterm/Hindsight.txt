Based on the provided network addresses:

1. **Network Address 1**: 223.15.224.0/19
   - This is a CIDR notation representing a network range.
   - The subnet mask is /19, which means the first 19 bits are the network address.
   - The network address is 223.15.224.0.

2. **Network Address 2**: 56.150.70.48/28
   - This is also a CIDR notation representing a network range.
   - The subnet mask is /28, which means the first 28 bits are the network address.
   - The network address is 56.150.70.48.

To find the last, second usable, and third usable IP addresses for each network, we need to determine the range of usable IP addresses within each subnet. 

For a subnet with CIDR notation /n, where n represents the number of bits in the network portion of the address:
- The number of usable IP addresses in the subnet is 2^(32-n) - 2.
- The first IP address in the subnet is the network address.
- The last IP address in the subnet is the broadcast address, which is the address where all host bits are set to 1.

Let's calculate the last, second usable, and third usable IP addresses for each network:

1. **Network Address 1: 223.15.224.0/19**
   - Subnet mask: /19
   - Number of usable IP addresses: 2^(32-19) - 2 = 2^13 - 2 = 8190
   - Last usable IP address: 223.15.255.254
   - Second usable IP address: 223.15.224.2
   - Third usable IP address: 223.15.224.3

2. **Network Address 2: 56.150.70.48/28**
   - Subnet mask: /28
   - Number of usable IP addresses: 2^(32-28) - 2 = 2^4 - 2 = 14
   - Last usable IP address: 56.150.70.62
   - Second usable IP address: 56.150.70.50
   - Third usable IP address: 56.150.70.51

So, for Network Address 1, the last usable IP address is 223.15.255.254, the second usable IP address is 223.15.224.2, and the third usable IP address is 223.15.224.3.

For Network Address 2, the last usable IP address is 56.150.70.62, the second usable IP address is 56.150.70.50, and the third usable IP address is 56.150.70.51.
