Vlan network
-> Network that is designed around the use of vlans

A VLAN is created to logically group devices based on their location, functions or other criteria.

 __S__ [P] _ [P] _ [P]
|__S__ [P] _ [P] _ [P]
|__S__ [P] _ [P] _ [P]
|      vl1   vl2   vl3
S
|
R

Pros:
 + Improve network performance: by reducing network congestion and increasing network efficiency.
 + Greater Flexibility and Scalability: Vlans can logically group devices which will allow both geographical and cost-eficenct benefit.
 + Cost-saving: Organizer can reduce the number of physical network required.

Cons:
 + Complexity: require extensive planning, configuration, and maintanance. Misconfiguration can results in network issuse and security vulnarabilities.
 + Broadcast storms: inadequate VLAN design or configuration can lead to broadcast storm. Where excessive broadcast traffic is floods, leading to congestion and performance degration
 + Limited scalability: configurationing and maintaining proper segmentation can become more challenging as the network grew bigger. Additionally, VLANs may not scale well accress physicall locations or rapid changing network requirements.

Inter-VLAN routing

Layer 2 needs router to forward traffic to foreign network, therefore inter-vlan routing is a process for forwarding network traffic from one vlan to another, using a router.


Traditional routing: Where multiple interfaces on the router is used to supplement multiple VLANS
pros: performance
cons: cost and not scalable

Router on a stick: When one physical interface is divided into multiple logical interfaces to supplement the use of VLANs
pros: cost and scalable
cons: complex configuration
