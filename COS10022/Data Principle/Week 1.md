## Introduction
### 1. What is Data Science
> To uncover actionable insights hidden in an organizationâ€™s data using a variety of skills and tools (math & statistics, programming, advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise). These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.


### 2. What is Big Data
Big data is data whose **scale**, **distribution**, **diversity**, and/or **timeliness** require the sue of new technical architectures and analytics o enable insights that unlock new sources of business value.

Data that exceeds the processing capacity of conventional database systems
- Too big (TB/PB level)
- Moves too fast
- New structure

Four Vs of Big data
- Volume
	- Scale
- Velocity
	- Timeliness
- Variety
	- Diversity
	- Distribution
- (Veracity)
	- Pertaining to the accuracy of data 

### 3. What drives Big Data
#### Moving from regular to big data
With proper data processing techniques, new knowledge or information can be extracted from the data generated by people in their daily life.

## Overview
### Data structures

### Data Devices
- Gather data from multiple locations
- Continuously generate new data about this data
- For each gigabytes created for this data, an additional Petabyte or data is created about this data

### Data Collectors
- Entities that collect data from the device and users
- E.g.: Streaming service provider (knows what you watch and how much you paid, etc.)

### Data Aggregators
- Entities that compile and make sense of the data collected by data collectors
- Transform and package the data as product to sell

### Data users and buyers
Direct benefactors of the data collected and aggregated by others within the data value chain.
E.g.: 
- Corporate customers
- Analytic services
- Media archives
- Advertising
- Information brokers
- Credit bureaus
- Catalogue co-ops

### Data Science vs Enterprise Data Warehouse
Data Warehouse (DW) is a relational database that is designed for query and analysis rather than for transaction processing. Contains selective, cleaned, and transformed historical data
- Extraction, Transformation, and Loading
- On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP)
- Supports enterprise decision making

Limitation of Enterprise DW analytics:
1. High-value data is hard to reach and leverage
-> Low priority for data science projects
2. Data usually moves in batches from DW to local analytics tools (e.g. R, SAS, Excel)
-> In-memory analytics; dataset size constraints
3. Data Science projects remain isolated and ad-hoc, rather than centrally managed
-> Data science initiatives not aligned with corporate strategic business goals

>[!Note]
>Data science is larger and better than Business intelligence

The 4 Vs of Big data will not work well with traditional EDW
- Centralized, purpose-built space (lack of agility)
- Supports Business Intelligence and Reporting (restrict robust analysis)
- Analyst must spend significant time to aggregate and dis-aggregate data from multiple sources (reduce timeliness)

>[!Note]
>To succeed, Big Data analytics need different approaches



## Big data ecosystem
### Drivers of big data
- Mobile Sensors
- Social Media
- Video Surveillance
- Video Rendering
- Smart Grids
- Geophysical Exploration
- Medical Imaging
- Gene Sequencing

### Key characteristics of Big Data
- Data volume
	- 44x increase from 20120 to 2020 (1.2 Zetta Bytes o 35.2 ZB) 
- Processing Complexity
	- Changing data structures
	- Use cases warranting additional transformations and analytical techniques
- Data structure
	- Greater variety of data structures to mine and analyze

### Emerging Big Data Ecosystem

### Analytic Sandbox (workspaces)
- Resolve the conflict between the needs of analysts and the traditional EDW or other formally managed corporate data
- Data Assets gathered from multiple sources and technologies for analysis
- Enables flexible, high-performance analysis in non-production environment
- Reduce costs and risks associated with data replication into "shadow" file systems
- Analyst owned rather than DBA owned
